  # Angular-Starter-NET-API-SQLDB
</h1>

This project is an Angular Starter with .NET REST API &amp; SQL-DB which includes angular material, ngx-gallery and CRUD operations. Contains everything you need to have to run an Angular application made from scratch to connect UI actions to a REST web-API in charge to handle http requests operations and store data into a SQL database using entity relational model, can't say is perfect because I wanted to invest more time to implement security with JWT and interceptors using route Guards, some API pattern like UnitOfWork and DB indexing but I'm pretty sure everything done is based on best SOLID practices. 
 
* Let's start from the beginning, take a look to attached DB script I made to create the business model, very basic to start your app, run this script in your empty database and results should match below screenshot.
