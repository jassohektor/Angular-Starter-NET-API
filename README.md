  # Angular-Starter-NET-API-SQLDB
</h1>

This project is an Angular Starter with .NET REST API &amp; SQL-DB which includes angular material, ngx-gallery and CRUD operations. Contains everything you need to have to run an Angular application made from scratch to connect UI actions to a REST web-API in charge to handle http requests operations and store data into a SQL database using entity relational model, can't say is perfect because I wanted to invest more time to implement security with JWT and interceptors using route Guards, some API pattern like UnitOfWork and DB indexing but I'm pretty sure everything done is based on best SOLID practices. 

Prerequisites:

- Angular CLI >= 9.0.5

* Let's start from the beginning, take a look to the attached DB script and remember to create your empty database before to run it, I made this script to create the business model very basic to start your app, run that script in your database and results should match below screenshot.

* Open the VS solution to load up both projects but change the startup project to target the "Web.Api" only and remember to update the appsettings.json schema with your server settings like Server name, Catalog, User and password, there is using my local database and the app won't work if you don't change that which is pretty obvious but just wanted to point it out.
